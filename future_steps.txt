Goals:

1) set up multi-paging
2) set up a "hidden" scrolling mechanism to allow the program to open an infinitely large text file.
  2a) set it up to calculate the number of characters it can have on the screen at any given time.
3) fix UI bugs(should be top)
4) User request - add OneNote compatibility- we'll see what the interop packages look like.
